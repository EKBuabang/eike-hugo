# Habits

 Habits play an important role in our lives. They form with repetition and allow us to interact with our environment in a cognitively efficient way. **Good habits** contribute to increased **productivity**, improved **physical health**, and enhanced **mental well-being**. 

 My primary research interest are the **core mechanisms** underlying **habits**. In my view, habits result from **goal-directed processes** that allow us to automatically represent potential beliefs and goals when presented with a familiar context.
 
 But some habitual behaviors are suboptimal, so-called **bad habits**.  If you know something is bad for you, **why is it so hard to stop?** I am trying to understand how goal-directed processes can go awry and lead to bad habits.
 
 Examples of behaviors that I am interested in vary in severity from everyday **action slips** (e.g., entering an old password), to **impulsive behaviors** (e.g., eating unhealthy foods), and on the extreme, **compulsive behaviors** (e.g., substance use or checking locks repetitively). 
 
 Through my work, I hope to offer insights into habit formation and expression, thereby helping to **make good habits and break bad habits**.
