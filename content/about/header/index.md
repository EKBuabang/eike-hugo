# Research Interests

Habits play an important role in our lives. They form with repetition and allow us to interact with our environment in a cognitively efficient way. **Good habits** contribute to increased **productivity**, improved **physical health**, and enhanced **mental well-being**.

My primary research interest are the **core mechanisms** underlying habits. In my view, habits result from **goal-directed processes** that allow us to automatically represent potential beliefs and goals when presented with a familiar context.

Whereas habits can be beneficial, some research suggests that over-relying on habits can lead to everyday **action slips** (e.g., entering an old password), to **impulsive behaviours** (e.g., eating unhealthy foods), and on the extreme, **compulsive behaviours** (e.g., substance use or checking locks repetitively). 

A key characteristic of these behaviours is that they are often against people's explicit beliefs and goals. In my work, I try to explain these seemingly contradictory behaviours with a **goal-directed framework**. in which they occur when peopleâ€™s belief and goal representations are incorrect or fail to update, or when competing representations exist.

Through my work, I hope to offer insights into habit formation and expression, thereby helping to **make good habits and break bad habits**.
