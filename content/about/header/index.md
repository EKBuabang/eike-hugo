# About Me

 I am a postdoctoral researcher in the  [Gillan Lab](https://gillanlab.com) working on the project “Making and Breaking a Habit”.

  I completed my PhD at KU Leuven supervised by Prof. [Agnes Moors](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/cscp/people/00012693), and co-supervised by Prof. Jan De Houwer and Prof. Marcel Brass. In my dissertation “The Role of Goal-Directed Processes in the Causation of Seemingly Habitual Behavior”, I investigated and formalized goal-directed accounts of behaviors that we typically consider habitual. My dissertation was runner up for the Belgian Association for Psychological Sciences best PhD thesis award 2023.
  
  Next to my PhD, I was selected as research supervisor in the [Junior Researcher Programme](https://jrp.pscholars.org) with my project "The poverty trap: A multinational study examining the relation between poverty, stress, financial literacy, and decision making".
  
  Previously I graduated cum laude with an M.Sc. (research) in Social & Organisational Psychology from Leiden University, and a B.Sc. in Psychology from the University of Groningen.
