description: I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Gillan Lab](https://gillanlab.com) at Trinity College Dublin. <br><br>  My primary research interest is the **cognitive neuroscience of habits**. I am particularly interested in understanding why people engage in behaviours that are against their explicit beliefs and goals such as **action slips** (e.g., entering an old password), **impulsive behaviours** (e.g., eating unhealthy foods), and **compulsive behaviours** (e.g., substance use or checking locks repetitively).
